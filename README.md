*Platforms and Technologies Used:* Windows, FTK Imager, WinPrefetchView, Autopsy, Excel  
*Languages Used:* Python, PowerShell

In this project, I conducted a forensic analysis of Windows prefetch files to extract critical data regarding program execution and system activity. Utilizing tools like FTK Imager and WinPrefetchView, I traced user activity, identified suspicious processes, and gathered evidence related to potential malware or unauthorized actions. By reconstructing a timeline of program usage, I correlated these events with possible security incidents, enhancing my forensic investigation skills. This project deepened my understanding of Windows-based forensic investigations and strengthened my ability to detect compromised systems.
